# I am 30 now, what is next

In the past decade I have been able to make somewhat of a mark for myself. I have a wonderful wife, great job and two most of the time great dogs. I do feel that I can improve in my career or rather start making moves that I hope to set my future self-up for success. When I started this blog last October I had an idea of what I would like it to be but I think I am going to change it to something new. I need something that will keep me on track and make me progress like I should be, so I am going to put down some time lines for myself. Things I would like to learn or do over the next year and we will see how it goes.

## TODO::
Each week I will research and complete a codekata and post it here or on GitHub.
Each month I will create a new project on GitHub. This can be small but something new.
Each quarter I will read and review a tech book.
Each year I will review my years progress by grading myself and create new goals for the next year.

## 2018 Goals
* Complete the above list. 
* Start work on ML
