## how did I get here

let me go into a little bet about me. I have been in the IT would for around 12 years now, started out in high school and never looked back. I have done everything from hardware setup to network/system administrator to now programming. I have been coding for about 6 years. I have learned a lot messed up more but like any good journey I feel the best year are yet to come.

## so what am I doing here

Right now, this could change I am using this blog as a place to keep code and guides that I need and will use over the course of my programming life. Those odd things that I always have to google and then find that one article against, let me just make my own how to that I would understand. In the process I hope that other people might find the examples useful. I will also be keeping notes and articles about different things I am working, problems that I might have and fixes that took me way to long to fix.

Well this is all for this one lets see what type of crazy stuff I am going to feel this site up with.
