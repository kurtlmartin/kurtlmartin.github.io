## how did I get here

let me go into a little bet about me. I have been in the IT would for around 12 years now, started out in high school and never looked back. I have done everything from hardware setup to network/system administrator to now programming. I have been coding for about 6 years. I have learned alot messed up more but like any good journey I feel the best year are yet to come.

## so what am I doing here
